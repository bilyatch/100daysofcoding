I'm gonna learn new thing related to data science and update you guys on a daily note

<i><u><h3>Day one</h2></u></i>
<h2>Fundamental of Machine Learning</h2>
<t> Here I've learned about Machine learning, use of it and types of ML system
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
Machine learing is the science of programming computer where the machine learns from the data 
 
 <h4>Uses:</h4>
 <ol type="1">
<li>Healthcare and Medical Diagnosis</li>
<li>Commute Predictions</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Smart Assistants</li>
<li>Optimizing Search Engine Results</li>
<li>Optimizing Search Engine Results</li>
<font size=-2>and many more</font>

<h4>Types of ML</h4>
<ul>
<li>Supervised learning</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning</li>
<li>Semi-supervised learning</li>
<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supervised learning </h3>
<t>A typical supervised learning task is classification. In Supervised learning data is labeled.

Some of the imp. supervised algorithm 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li> k-Nearest Neighbors</li>
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</li>
<li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
<li>Neural networks2</li>
</ul>
 
 <h3>Unsupervised learning</h3>
 Here, Data is not labeled.
 Some of the unsupervised algorithm are:
 <ol>
 <li> Clustering/li>
 <ul>
<li> K-Means</li>
<li> DBSCAN</li>
<li> Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)</li>
  </ul>
<li>Anomaly detection and novelty detection</li>
   <ul>
<li>One-class SVM</li>
<li>Isolation Forest</li>
  </ul>
<li>Visualization and dimensionality reduction</li>
     <ul>
<li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</li>
<li>Kernel PCA</li>
<li>Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)</li>
<li>t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)</li>
<li>Association rule learning</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
<li>Aprior</li>
         </ul>
 
 <h3>Semi-supervised learning</h3>
  In this learning algorithm we uses little bit of labeled and alot of unlabeled data
  
  <h3>Reinforecement learning</h3>
  This learning algorithm observe the environment,select and perform actions, get reward in return or get negative reward. This learing algorithm should learn itself what's the best strategy for the problem which is called policy.

  <tr>
    <td> In batch learning, data is accumulated over a period of time and the machine learning model is then trained with this accumulated data from time to time in batches</td>
    <td>Online learning is a method of machine learning where data is processed in real-time as it arrives</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>The model is unable to learn incrementally from a stream of live data</td>
    <td>Online learning algorithms take an initial guess model and then pick up one observation from the training population and recalibrate the weights on each input parameter</td>

   <td> In instance-based learning, also known as memory-based learning, the algorithm memorizes the training examples and uses them to make predictions on new data.</td>
   <td> In contrast, model-based learning aims to learn a generalizable model that can be used to make predictions on new data</td>
